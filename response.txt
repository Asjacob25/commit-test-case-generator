Without the specific code changes in the diff, I am unable to generate precise unit test cases. However, I can provide you with a generic template that you can fill in with the specific changes from the git diff. 

Here is a simple template for a Python unittest test case:

```python
import unittest

# Import the module/class that contains the code changes
from my_module import MyClass

class TestMyClass(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_example_change(self):
        # Add your test case based on the specific code change
        # For example:
        # obj = MyClass()
        # self.assertEqual(obj.method(), expected_output)
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

You can fill in the necessary details in the `test_example_change` method based on the actual code changes. This template assumes that the code changes are related to a class named `MyClass` in the module `my_module`. 

Feel free to provide more specific details from the git diff if you need a more tailored unit test case.
