It appears there was an issue with the file or directory path in the initial test command. To correct this, ensure that the test command is executed from the correct directory, and the path to the test file accurately reflects the project structure. Assuming the file structure is correctly set up and the `pytest` command is executed in the correct context, here's an improved version of the test cases, ensuring all scenarios are covered and there's a clarification on handling string inputs for mathematical operations which initially could have raised concerns:

```python
import pytest
from utils import operations  # Adjusted import based on the file structure described

# Assuming string concatenation is not a desired operation for the add function,
# and such cases should be handled or tested differently.

# Tests for add function
@pytest.mark.parametrize("x, y, expected_result", [
    (5, 2, 7),
    (3.5, 2.5, 6.0),
    (-1, -1, -2),
    (0, 0, 0)
])
def test_add_with_numerical_values(x, y, expected_result):
    """Test add function with numerical inputs"""
    assert operations.add(x, y) == expected_result

# Test for error cases, including potential misuse with strings
def test_add_with_string_raises_type_error():
    """Test add function raises TypeError with string input"""
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        operations.add("Hello ", "World")

# Tests for subtract function with a new edge case
@pytest.mark.parametrize("x, y, expected_result", [
    (10, 5, 5),
    (3.5, 2.5, 1.0),
    (-1, 1, -2),
    (0, 0, 0),
    (1, 3, -2)  # Edge case: result is negative
])
def test_subtract(x, y, expected_result):
    """Test subtract function with a variety of inputs"""
    assert operations.subtract(x, y) == expected_result

# Additional test for multiply function to include edge case of multiplying by zero
@pytest.mark.parametrize("x, y, expected_result", [
    (10, 5, 50),
    (3.0, 2.5, 7.5),
    (-1, 1, -1),
    (0, 1, 0),
    (5, 0, 0)  # Edge case: multiplying by zero
])
def test_multiply(x, y, expected_result):
    """Test multiply function with normal and edge case inputs"""
    assert operations.multiply(x, y) == expected_result

# Testing power function including a negative exponent
@pytest.mark.parametrize("x, y, expected_result", [
    (2, 3, 8),
    (3.0, -2.0, 1/9.0),  # Negative exponent
    (-1, 2, 1),
    (10, 0, 1)  # Exponent is zero
])
def test_power(x, y, expected_result):
    """Test power function including negative exponent and exponent zero cases"""
    assert operations.power(x, y) == expected_result

# Improved divide tests to include negative and floating point numbers
@pytest.mark.parametrize("x, y, expected_result", [
    (10, 5, 2),
    (5.0, 2.5, 2.0),
    (-10, 5, -2),
    (0, 1, 0),
    (7.5, -3, -2.5)  # Negative divisor
])
def test_divide(x, y, expected_result):
    """Test divide function with normal, negative, and floating point inputs"""
    assert operations.divide(x, y) == expected_result

def test_divide_by_zero():
    """Test divide function correctly handles division by zero"""
    assert operations.divide(10, 0) == "Cannot divide by zero"

# This test assumes that operations handling non-numeric types should raise a TypeError,
# which wasn't explicitly handled in the provided code. Depending on the implementation details,
# you might want to adjust the operations.py functions to explicitly raise TypeErrors for non-numeric inputs.
@pytest.mark.parametrize("x, y", [
    (None, 1),
    (1, None),
    ("string", 2),
    ("1", "2")  # Including string representations of numbers
])
def test_all_operations_with_invalid_types(x, y):
    """Test all operation functions raise TypeError with invalid (non-numeric) inputs"""
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        operations.add(x, y)
        operations.subtract(x, y)
        operations.multiply(x, y)
        operations.power(x, y)
        operations.divide(x, y)
```

This version ensures:
- Handling of non-numeric types to expect a `TypeError`, which should be implemented in the `operations.py` file if not already.
- Coverage of more edge cases, such as negative numbers, division by zero, and multiplying by zero.
- Avoids testing unsupported operations (like string concatenation) unless specifically required by the application's context.

Make sure to adjust the import statement based on the actual project structure and run `pytest` from the root of the project or adjust the PYTHONPATH environment variable accordingly to avoid the "file or directory not found" error.
