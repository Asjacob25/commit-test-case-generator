The error you're encountering, "ERROR: file or directory not found: operations.py," suggests a problem with locating the `operations.py` file rather than an issue with the test cases themselves. The test cases provided are comprehensive and should cover a wide range of scenarios for the operations defined in `operations.py`. 

However, to address the problem and assuming the test cases are correct as they align with the requirements, let's ensure that:

1. The test file (`test_operations.py`) is located in the correct directory relative to `operations.py`. If `operations.py` is in `utils/`, make sure that your test file is either in the same directory or correctly references the location of `operations.py`.

2. If you're running the tests from a different directory, you might need to adjust the command to point to the correct path where your test file is located. For example, if your test file is in the `tests/` directory, you need to run pytest with `pytest tests/`.

3. Ensure that your pytest command is executed in the environment where `operations.py` exists, and your current working directory in the terminal or command prompt is set correctly to the root of your project or to a directory above `utils/`.

Given the structure of your project as described, there's no modification needed in the test cases themselves based on the error message you received. The issue is related to the pytest environment setup or the way pytest was invoked. 

To ensure your test environment is correctly set up, you can follow these steps:

- Navigate to your project root directory in the terminal.
- Ensure your project structure is something like this:

```
project_root/
│
├── tests/
│   └── test_operations.py
│
└── utils/
    └── operations.py
```

- Run pytest with the correct path, for example, `pytest tests/test_operations.py` if your terminal's current directory is the project root.

If your project structure is different, adjust the paths accordingly. Make sure pytest is installed in your environment (`pip install pytest`), and consider using a Python virtual environment if not already doing so to manage dependencies more effectively.
