Given the error message you received, it appears that pytest could not locate the `operations.py` file. This usually occurs because of a mismatch in the directory structure or incorrect file path specification. However, the test cases provided in the previous response are correct regarding the code coverage and testing different scenarios for each function in the `operations.py` file. The error is not related to the quality or coverage of the test cases but rather to the environment setup or command used to run the tests.

To resolve the specified issue, ensure the following:

1. **Correct Directory Structure:** Make sure your `operations.py` file is located in the `utils` directory and that your tests (let's call it `test_operations.py`) are either in the same directory or in a designated tests directory (commonly `tests`).

2. **Running Pytest Correctly:** When running pytest, ensure you are in the root directory of your project (the directory that contains the `utils` directory). If your tests are in a separate directory, you might need to adjust the PYTHONPATH or use the `-s` flag with pytest to specify the directory containing your tests.

3. **Specifying the Correct Path:** If you're running pytest with a specific file as an argument, ensure you're providing the correct path relative to your current directory. For example:
    - If you are in the root directory, you might run `pytest utils/test_operations.py`
    - Or, if your tests are inside a `tests` folder, `pytest tests/test_operations.py`

If your project structure is correctly set up and you're still facing issues, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- **Check for Typographical Errors:** Make sure there are no typos in your file names or paths.
- **Pytest Discovery Rules:** Pytest follows certain naming conventions to discover test files and functions. By default, pytest identifies any file named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` as a test file. Ensure your test file follows this convention.
- **Environment Issue:** If you're using a virtual environment, ensure it's activated. Sometimes, running pytest outside an active environment can lead to unexpected behaviors.

Given the original task, the provided test cases are comprehensive and cover a wide range of scenarios, including normal cases, edge cases, and error cases. The issue you're facing is related to environment setup or command execution rather than the test cases themselves.
