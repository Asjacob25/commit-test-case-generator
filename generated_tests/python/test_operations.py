Based on the error message you received, it seems like pytest could not locate the `operations.py` file. This issue is unrelated to the quality or coverage of the test cases provided. It’s a common issue related to the file path or environment setup in pytest.

However, to ensure the tests are discoverable and runnable, please make sure of the following:

1. **Correct File Location**: Ensure `operations.py` is located in the `utils` directory relative to where you are running pytest. The directory structure should look something like this:

```
project_root/
│
├── tests/
│   └── test_operations.py
│
└── utils/
    └── operations.py
```

2. **Correct Test Invocation**: You need to run pytest from the `project_root` directory, ensuring pytest can discover both the tests and the modules they are meant to test.

3. **__init__.py Files**: Make sure each directory (like `utils` and `tests`) contains an `__init__.py` file to make Python treat the directories as containing packages. This is not strictly necessary for Python 3.3 and later, but it's a good practice for compatibility and can sometimes resolve import issues.

4. **Pytest Configuration**: If the directory structure is more complex or different from the standard conventions, you might need to adjust your pytest configuration. You can do this in a `pytest.ini`, `tox.ini`, or `pyproject.toml` file in your project root.

Given the error message, there are no issues with the test cases themselves regarding covering failed or missed scenarios based on your original request. 

If you have ensured all the above and the problem persists, consider running pytest with the `-v` (verbose) flag to get more detailed output, which might help diagnose the issue:

```
pytest -v
```

Or, explicitly specify the test directory:

```
pytest tests/
```

This command assumes your tests are located in a `tests` directory at the root of your project. Adjust the path accordingly if your setup is different.
